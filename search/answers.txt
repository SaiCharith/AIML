Task 3 : Why DFS Algorithm? Can we perform informed search?
	We can try heuristics like number of places there are more than one possible numbers that can be filled.
	

Task 7 : Why A* Algorithm? Possible Heuristic for Travelling Student Problem: 
	Any state which is closer to start state than goal state will be visited in Dijkstras
	In case of multiple goal states, for any state min{Euclidian distance form state to goal state i} can be used.
	This is a consistent heuristic.
	For any n1,n2 if n1 and n2 have same goal state has closest goal state then its consistent.
	If n1 has g1 as shortest goal state and n2 has g2, then
		d(n1,g1)<=c(n1,n2)+d(n2,g1)		(1)
		d(n1,g2)<=c(n1,n2)+d(n2,g2)		(2)   
		d(n1,g1)<=d(n1,g2)				(3)
		d(n2,g2)<=d(n2,g1)				(4)

	Using (2),(3)
		d(n1,g1)<=d(n1,g2)<=c(n1,n2)+d(n2,g2)
	which is d(n1,g1)<=c(n1,n2)+d(n2,g2)

	Therefore our heuristic is consistant.
